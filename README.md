# Universalis-watch-releases
Releases for the Universalis watch plugin.

## What does it do?
The plugin periodically queries the Universalis API with the in-game items the user has added.<br/>
If the price drops below the threshold or rises above it, the user will be notified.<br/>
I'm aware there's not a site to find the best profitable items, this is not meant for this.<br/>
This is an ease of use tool to tell you when an item you want goes below a price.

## What is this UI?
I wanted to re-use an older UI I've made for an 'extension' for another game. I find it better looking then Stock ImGui.

## Those weird notifications, can those be turned off?
Yes, just click the settings button.

# Credits.
FmauNeko - I've re-used a few bits and pieces of the Marketboard plugin. (Universalis API query and Item listing sorting)
